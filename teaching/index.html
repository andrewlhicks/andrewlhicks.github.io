					<h2>Teaching</h2>
					<p>Teaching is one of my great passions.
					I love not only mathematics, but explaining it to others in an easy-to-understand way.
					My philosophy of teaching is that anyone can learsn math if they put in the hard work!
					My job is to guide the student in this pursuit and give them the confidence to succeed.</p>

					<h3>Student testimonials</h3>
					<p>
						"He has dry humor which is one of the best features of his teaching approach. He loves making references to pop culture and he isn't afraid to admit he is wrong. Overall I would rate him a 5 [out of 5]." &ndash; <i>RateMyProfessors.com<sup>1</sup> on Nov. 7, 2023</i>
					<p>
						"I am so glad I got to take him for calc 1. He is great at explaining things and always went over homework problems if we asked. He's a great professor." &ndash; <i>RateMyProfessors.com on Oct. 28, 2023</i>
					</p>
					<p>
						"So far, he has been the best professor that has taught me. It's math so obviously pay attention, but he will help you if you need it." &ndash; <i>RateMyProfessors.com on Oct. 10, 2023</i>
					</p>
					<p>
						"Professor Hicks is one of the best professors I've had so far. If its [sic] not his amazing personality making the class fun and welcoming to be in, its [sic] the relationship he has with his students. I had some trouble with the class and his office hours really helped me understand the course material. I would 100% take one of his classes again." &ndash; <i>RateMyProfessors.com on Dec. 12, 2022</i>
					</p>
					<p>
						"Very funny and sweet, he cares about his students and does his best to help. A test heavy class but gives bonus on tests and homework. There are pop quizzes but if you have been understanding the material than you should be fine. Overall a great teacher and I would take him again." &ndash; <i>RateMyProfessors.com on Dec. 3, 2022</i>
					</p>
					<p>
						"He's very easy to connect with via email or office hours, and I can tell he genuinely wants to help every student as much as possible. He's a great teacher." &ndash; <i>Anonymous student via LSU Communication Across the Curriculum on Nov. 22, 2022</i>
					</p>
					<p>
						"Great job overall, I'm pretty sure he is a grad student in addition to teaching, and still has the knowledge and communication skill to keep students engaged effectively and carry out his lesson plans in a timely manner, while exceeding the requirements of someone in his position." &ndash; <i>Anonymous student via LSU Communication Across the Curriculum on Nov. 22, 2022</i>
					</p>
					<p>
						"Great prof for calc. Show up to class and don't cheat on the homework and you should get an A. You can ask him to go over certain HW problems in class and he will. He pushes back due dates if necessary. He does do quizzes but they aren't insanely difficult, and his tests have bonus questions." &ndash; <i>RateMyProfessors.com on Nov. 21, 2022</i>
