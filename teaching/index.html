					<h2>Teaching</h2>
					<p>Teaching is one of my great passions.
					I love not only mathematics, but explaining it to others in an easy-to-understand way.
					My philosophy of teaching is that success in mathematics is mostly dependent on the hard work and dedication one puts into it, primarily with regard to practicing problems.
					Therefore, many students who otherwise think that they are not "smart" enough to learn math, can do so with the right direction from their teachers.
					My job is to guide the student in this pursuit and give them the confidence to succeed.</p>
					<p>Click <a target="_blank" href="../documents/Andrew_Hicks_Teaching_Statement.pdf">here</a> to view my teaching statement, where I explain my teaching philosophy in greater detail.</p>
