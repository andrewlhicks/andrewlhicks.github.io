					<h2>Teaching</h2>
					<p>Teaching is one of my great passions.
					I love not only mathematics, but explaining it to others in an easy-to-understand way.
					My philosophy of teaching is that anyone can learn math if they put in the hard work!
					My job is to guide the student in this pursuit and give them the confidence to succeed.</p>
					<p>Click <a target="_blank" href="../documents/Andrew_Hicks_Teaching_Statement.pdf">here</a> to view my teaching statement, where I explain my teaching philosophy in greater detail.</p>
