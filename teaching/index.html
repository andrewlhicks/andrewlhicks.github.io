					<h2>Teaching</h2>
					<p>Teaching is one of my great passions.
					I love not only mathematics, but explaining it to others in an easy-to-understand way.
					My philosophy of teaching is that anyone can learn math if they put in the hard work!
					My job is to guide the student in this pursuit and give them the confidence to succeed.</p>
					<p>Click <a target="_blank" href="../documents/Andrew_Hicks_Teaching_Statement.pdf">here</a> to view my teaching statement, where I explain my teaching philosophy in greater detail.</p>

				<h3>Student testimonials</h3>

						"Best college professor by far. Really cared about his students and did whatever he could to make sure we succeeded. If you put the effort in and show that you want to do well, he will reciprocate that energy and help you. Super funny and relatable to his students; sad that I will not be taking him again. Cannot say enough good things about Hicks!" &ndash; <i><a target="_blank" href="https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/professor/2515421">RateMyProfessors.com</a> on Dec 11, 2023</i>
