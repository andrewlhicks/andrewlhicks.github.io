					<h2>Teaching</h2>
					<p>Teaching is one of my great passions.
					I love not only mathematics, but explaining it to others in an easy-to-understand way.
					My philosophy of teaching is that anyone can learsn math if they put in the hard work!
					My job is to guide the student in this pursuit and give them the confidence to succeed.</p>

If its [sic] not his amazing personality making the class fun and welcoming to be in, its [sic] the relationship he has with his students.
