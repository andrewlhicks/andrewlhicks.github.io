					<h2>Programming</h2>

					<h3>Programming experience</h3>
					<p>
						I have experience in several programming languages:
						<ul>
							<li>
								<span class="title">Python</span>I have nearly four years of experience writing software in Python.
								I created my own software in Python called <i>Q-Tensor-3D</i> (see below), to solve the Landau-de Gennes free energy problem.
								I gave a four part, 8 hour lecture series in the Fall of 2021 called "Python for Beginners", via Zoom.
							</li>
							<li>
								<span class="title">HTML/CSS/Javascript</span> I have written the base design for websites, including <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dhicksconsulting.com">dhicksconsulting.com</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gregorycc.com">gregorycc.com</a>, using HTML and CSS, as well as some Javascript.
							</li>
							<li>
								<span class="title">Linux</span> I am quite familiar with using Linux's command line and can do basic shell scripting.
							</li>
							<li>
								<span class="title">LaTeX</span> This one goes without saying, as every mathematician should know how to use LaTeX well to write papers.
							</li>
							<li>
								<span class="title">C++</span> The latest programming language I've dipped my feet into is C++.
								The learning curve has been pretty high for this one, but I'm confident I can master this language as well!
							</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<h3>Software packages</h3>
					<p>
						The software packages I have written or are currently working on are listed below:
						<ul>
							<li>
								<span class="title">Q-Tensor-3d (<a href="https://github.com/andrewlhicks/q-tensor-3d" target="_blank">GitHub</a>)</span>
								I wrote this software package to solve the Landau-de Gennes free energy problem.
								The software is written in Python, and uses the package <a target="_blank" href="https://www.firedrakeproject.org/">Firedrake</a>, an open source FEM package likewise written in Python.
							</li>
							<li>
								<span class="title">SymPyPlus (<a href="https://github.com/andrewlhicks/sympyplus" target="_blank">GitHub</a>)</span>
								This package extends SymPy to be able to do calculus of variations.
								I use this in conjunction with <i>Q-Tensor-3d</i>.
							</li>
						</ul>
